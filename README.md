Learning Web Development

Welcome to my web development journey — a space where I explore how the web truly works.  
From crafting simple HTML pages to styling with CSS and adding life with JavaScript, this repo documents every step of my growth.

Goals
- Master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Understand the structure and logic behind websites  
- Build responsive and interactive projects  
- Practice using Git and GitHub for real development  
 

Vision
To grow from a beginner into a creative and confident web developer — one project at a time.  

“The web is my canvas, and code is my brush.”
